<div class="entry"><p id="alzheimer's disease"> <div class="entrytitle">12. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE</div><br>Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a term coined by Alois Alzheimer in 1907, is a relentlessly progressive disease char<a href="#act">act</a>erized by cognitive decline, behavioural disturbances, and changes in personality. Current estimates of prevalence of AD in Canada suggest that 5.1% of all Canadians 65 and over meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of AD, which translates into approximately 161,000 cases. AD prevalence is slightly higher in women than in men. It may be that this difference is due to the longer life expectancy of women although other f<a href="#act">act</a>ors have not been <a href="#rule">rule</a>d out. The prevalence of <a href="#dementia">dementia</a> is strongly associated with age, affecting 1% of the Canadian population aged 65 to 74, 6.9% of individuals 75-84 and 26% of individuals 85 years and older (Canadian Study of Health and Aging, 1994). The diagnostic criteria for <a href="#dementia">dementia</a> of the Alzheimer's Type (DAT) are as follows: A. The development of multiple cognitive deficits manifested by both: Memory impairment (impaired ability to learn new information or to recall previously learned information) One or more of the following cognitive disturbances: <a href="#aphasia">aphasia</a> (language disturbance) apraxia (impaired ability to carry out motor <a href="#act">act</a>ivities despite int<a href="#act">act</a> motor function) agnosia (failure to recognize or identify objects despite int<a href="#act">act</a> sensory function) disturbances in <a href="#executive function">executive function</a>ing (i.e., planning, organizing, sequencing, abstr<a href="#act">act</a>ing) B. The cognitive deficits in Criteria A1 and A2 each cause significant impairment in social and occupational functioning and represent a significant decline from a previous level of functioning. C. The course is char<a href="#act">act</a>erized by gradual onset and continuing cognitive decline D. The cognitive deficits in Criteria A1 and A2 are not due to any of the following: (1) other <a href="#central nervous system">central nervous system</a> condit<a href="#ions">ions</a> that cause progressive deficits in <a href="#memory">memory</a> and <a href="#cognition">cognition</a> (e.g., cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, subdural hematoma, normal pressure hydrocephalus, <a href="#brain tumor">brain tumor</a>). (2) systemic condit<a href="#ions">ions</a> that are known to cause a <a href="#dementia">dementia</a> (e.g., hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency, hypercalcemia, neurosyphilis, HIV infection) (3) substance-induced condit<a href="#ions">ions</a> E. The deficits do not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium F. The disturbance is not better accounted for by another Axis 1 disorder (e.g., Major Depressive Disorder, Schizophrenia) American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. Washington, D.C, American Psychiatric Association, 1994. The diagnosis of AD is based on exclusionary criteria (i.e., the absence of an identifiable cause) with diagnosis confirmed at autopsy. Treatment strategies to date have been largely ineffective, with experimental treatments mainly directed toward overcoming the cholinergic deficit.

Thagard, Mind: Introduction to Cognitive Science, second edition, MIT Press, 2005</div><br>
In cognitive psychology, <a href="#analogy">analogy</a> is considered an important method of problem solving. The problem solver attempts to use his or her knolwedge of one problem to solve another problem about which she or he has very little or no information. Barsalou (1992) provides the following example of problem solving by <a href="#analogy">analogy</a>: "...someone who has worked at the complex for a while could simply explain to you that the layout is analogous to a starfish. On hearing this <a href="#analogy">analogy</a> you might transfer knowledge about starfish to the office complex. Thus the knowledge that a starfish has a circular body, with five legs extending from it radially and symetrically would lead to the belief that the office complex contains a center circular body, with five tapered buildings extending from it in a radially symmetric pattern." (p.110) Obviously people do not use all of their knowledge about one problem to solve another problem. In the context of his starfish example Barsalou points out that we would not begin to think that the office complex is alive, or that it lives underwater. One problem facing cogntive psychologists is to determine how people decide upon the extent to which an <a href="#analogy">analogy</a> applies. Determining how this may be done is more difficult than it may seem. Consider that, given enough time people can find analogies between any two phenomena. We might want to say that, like the starfish, the office complex is alive its heating ducts are like blood vessels, its doors are like mouths eating the people who enter the office complex every day. As a cognitive process <a href="#analogy">analogy</a> seems limitless. In a science that strives for regularity and lawfulness the limitlessness of analogical thinking poses a serious problem.

The first component is a phonological <a href="#memory">memory</a> store which can hold traces of acoustic or speech based material. Material in this short term store lasts about two seconds unless it is maintained through the use of the second subcomponent, articulatory subvocal rehearsal. Prevention of articulatory rehearsal results in very rapid forgetting. Try this experiment with a friend. Present your friend with three consonants (e.g., C-X-Q) and ask them to recall the consonants after a 10 second delay. During the 10 second interval, prevent your friend from rehearsing the consonants by having them count 'backwards by threes' starting at 100. You will find that your friend's recall is significantly impaired! See Murdoch (1961) and Baddeley (1986) for a complete review. Baddeley, A. (1986). Working <a href="#memory">memory</a>.

<div class="entry"><p id="artificial intelligence"> <div class="entrytitle">31. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</div><br>The study of how computers can be programmed to perceive, reason, and <a href="#act">act</a>.<br><div class="source"> P. Thagard, Mind: Introduction to Cognitive Science, second edition, MIT Press, 2005</div><br>
Artificial intelligence is concerned with the attempt to develop complex computer programs that will be capable of performing difficult cognitive tasks. Some of those who work in <a href="#artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> are relatively unconcerned as to whether the programs they devise mimic human cognitive functioning, while others have the explicit goal of simulating human <a href="#cognition">cognition</a> on the computer. The <a href="#artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> approach has been applied to several different areas within cognitive psychology, including <a href="#perception">perception</a>, <a href="#memory">memory</a>, imagery, thinking, and problem solving. There are a number of advantages of the <a href="#artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> approach to <a href="#cognition">cognition</a>. Computer programming requires that every process be specified in detail, unlike cognitive psychology which often relies on vague descript<a href="#ions">ions</a>. AI also tends to be highly theoretical, which leads to general theoretical orientat<a href="#ions">ions</a> having wide applicability. The main disadvantage of AI is that there is a lot of controversy about the ultimate similarity between human cognitive functioning and computer functioning. Some of the major differences between brains and computers were spelled out in the following terms by Churchland (1989, p.100): "The brain seems to be a computer with a radically different style. For example, the brain changes as it learns, it appears to store and process information in the same places...Most obviously, the brain is a <a href="#parallel">parallel</a> machine, in which many inter<a href="#act">act</a><a href="#ions">ions</a> occur at the same time in many different channels." This contrasts with most computer funct<a href="#ions">ions</a> which involves serial processing and relatively few inter<a href="#act">act</a><a href="#ions">ions</a>. Churchland, P.S. (1989).

<div class="entry"><p id="attention"> <div class="entrytitle">35. ATTENTION</div><br>"Attention" is a term commonly used in education, <a href="#psychiatry">psychiatry</a> and psychology. The definition is often vague. Attention can be defined as an inte<a href="#rna">rna</a>l cognitive process by which one <a href="#act">act</a>ively selects environmental information (ie. sensation) or <a href="#act">act</a>ively processes information from inte<a href="#rna">rna</a>l sources (ie. visceral cues or other thought processes). In more general terms, <a href="#attention">attention</a> can be defined as an ability to focus and maintain interest in a given task or idea, including managing distr<a href="#act">act</a><a href="#ions">ions</a>. William James, a 19th century psychologist explains <a href="#attention">attention</a> as follows: "Everyone knows what <a href="#attention">attention</a> is. It is the taking possession by the mind in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought...It implies withdrawl from some things in order to deal effectively with others, and is a condition which has a real opposite in the confused, dazed, scatterbrained state." (p. 403) Attention is important to psychologists because it is often considered a core cognitive process, a basis on which to study other cognitive processes; most importantly learning. DeGangi and Porges (1990) illustrate only "when a person is <a href="#act">act</a>ively engaged in voluntary <a href="#attention">attention</a>, functional purposeful <a href="#act">act</a>ivity and learning can occur." (p. 6) Poor <a href="#attention">attention</a> is often a key symptom of behaviour disorders such as hyper<a href="#act">act</a>ivity and learning disorders. DeGangi, Georgia and Porges, Stephen.

<div class="entry"><p id="attention getting"> <div class="entrytitle">37. ATTENTION GETTING</div><br>Attention getting is more than just the orienting reflex, it is the "initial orientation or alerting to a stimulus." Though this may be considered an automatic <a href="#act">act</a>, in f<a href="#act">act</a> it requires complex <a href="#act">act</a>ive thought processing. Attention getting is reliant on the qualitative nature of the stimulus. The stimulus must be stong enough to elicit a response. DeGangi and Porges (1990) explain the types of stimuli that are <a href="#attention">attention</a> getting vary according to past experiences of the individual, what they already know, individual re<a href="#act">act</a>ivity to sensory stimuli, and what an individual has determined to be important to them. A hungry person may be more apt to pay <a href="#attention">attention</a> to the smell of food than the sounds surrounding them in a traffic jam! Attention getting is important to psychologists, particularily developmental psychologists because of its role in learning. A child's chosen <a href="#attention">attention</a> getting stimuli can guide his/her learning abilities. "A child who learns better through the auditory channel will orient more readily to a song about body parts than a picture of a body." DeGangi, Georgia and Porges, Stephen. (1990).

<div class="entry"><p id="attention holding"> <div class="entrytitle">38. ATTENTION HOLDING</div><br>Attention holding is the "maintenance of <a href="#attention">attention</a> when a stimulus is intricate or novel." Stimuli that hold our <a href="#attention">attention</a> must be both novel and complex in order to encourage information processing. Attention holding is measured by how long one engages in a cognitive <a href="#act">act</a>ivity involving that stimulus. Attention holding is important because of its role in learning. If an <a href="#act">act</a>ivity or stimulus is moderately complex, the person will expend energy in information processing. In other words, the person will expend energy in learning. Unfortunately, this can be complicated by poor motivation. Low motivation may present a challenge as the psychologist (or other professional) must determine if the decreased motivation is due to sensory processing problems, cognitive impairment, or other learning-related problems (of which poor <a href="#attention">attention</a> holding may be identified).

<div class="entry"><p id="attention releasing"> <div class="entrytitle">39. ATTENTION RELEASING</div><br>Attention releasing is the final stage in DeGangi and Porges' (1990) process of sustained <a href="#attention">attention</a>. Attention releasing can simply be defined as the "releasing or turning off of <a href="#attention">attention</a> from a stimulus." Attention releasing can occur for a variety of reasons. A person can fatigue physically or mentally requiring release of <a href="#attention">attention</a>. Arousal level can decrease, therefore a different type/strength of stimuli becomes required to maintain an alert and <a href="#act">act</a>ive state. Attention releasing provides a person with a method to reach closure on a given <a href="#act">act</a>ivity, task, or event thereby allowing that person to switch <a href="#attention">attention</a> to something new. As with <a href="#attention">attention</a> getting and holding, <a href="#attention">attention</a> releasing (the ability to shift focus) plays an important role in the learning process.

The most widely known <a href="#theory">theory</a> of childhood cognitive development was proposed by Jean Piaget in 1969. He proposed the idea that cognitive development consisted of the development of logical competence, and that the development of this competence consists of four major stages (sensori-motor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational). He also argued that a child's cognitive performance depended more on the stage of development he was in than on the specific task being performed. More recent studies have cast some doubt on Piaget's <a href="#theory">theory</a> of homogeneous performance within a given stage. Instead, it is now believed that performance varies greatly within each stage and depends more on the acquisition and development of language, <a href="#perception">perception</a>, decision <a href="#rule">rule</a>s, and real-world knowledge for any individual child.<br><div class="source">http://penta.ufrgs.br/edu/telelab/3/entries.htm</div><br>

Horn (1970) hypothesized that because <a href="#crystallized intelligence">crystallized intelligence</a> is based on learning and experience, it remains relatively stable over time. He claims it may even increase "as the rate at which we acquire or learn new information in the course of living balances out or exceeds the rate at which we forget." (as quoted in Belsky, 1990, p. 125) On the other side of the debate, Belsky (1990) claims <a href="#crystallized intelligence">crystallized intelligence</a> in f<a href="#act">act</a> declines with age. Why? Because, "at a certain time of life the cumulative effect of losses - of job, of health, of relat<a href="#ions">ions</a>hips - cause disengagement from the <a href="#culture">culture</a>, and so forgetting finally exceeds the rate at which knowledge is acquired."

<div class="entry"><p id="deductive (logical) inference"> <div class="entrytitle">126. DEDUCTIVE (LOGICAL) INFERENCE</div><br>Inferences are made when a person (or machine) goes beyond available evidence to form a conclusion. With a deductive inference, this conclusion always follows the stated premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion is valid. Studies of human efficiency in deductive inference involves conditional reasoning problems which follow the "if A, then B" format. The task of making <a href="#deduction">deduction</a>s consists of three stages. First, a person must understand the meaning of the premises. Next they must be able to formulate a valid conclusion. Thirdly, a person should evaluate their conclusion to tests its validity.

Dementia is a clinical state char<a href="#act">act</a>erized by loss of function in multiple cognitive domains. The most commonly used criteria for diagnoses of <a href="#dementia">dementia</a> is the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, American Psychiatric Association). Diagnostic <a href="#features">features</a> include : <a href="#memory">memory</a> impairment and at least one of the following: <a href="#aphasia">aphasia</a>, apraxia, agnosia, disturbances in <a href="#executive function">executive function</a>ing. In addition, the cognitive impairments must be severe enough to cause impairment in social and occupational functioning. Importantly, the decline must represent a decline from a previously higher level of functioning. Finally, the diagnosis of <a href="#dementia">dementia</a> should NOT be made if the cognitive deficits occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. There are many different types of <a href="#dementia">dementia</a> (approximately 70 to 80). Some of the major disorders causing <a href="#dementia">dementia</a> are: Degenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease) Vascular Dementia (e.g., Multi-infarct Dementia) Anoxic Dementia (e.g., Cardiac Arrest) Traumatic Dementia (e.g., Dementia pugilistica [boxer's <a href="#dementia">dementia</a>]) Infectious Dementia (e.g., Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) Toxic Dementia (e.g., Alcoholic Dementia) 7.9 % of all Canadians 65 years and older meet the criteria for the clinical diagnoses of <a href="#dementia">dementia</a> (Canadian Study on Health and Aging, 1994). Alzheimer's Disease is the major cause of <a href="#dementia">dementia</a>, accounting for 64% of all <a href="#dementia">dementia</a>s in Canada for persons 65 and older and 75% of all <a href="#dementia">dementia</a>s for persons 85 plus.

First, pre<a href="#concept">concept</a>ions are used to set aside portions of the field of experience for further <a href="#attention">attention</a>, that is, <a href="#perception">perception</a> is focused on predetermined stimuli. Second, people <a href="#act">act</a> within the context of these portions of experience guided by pre<a href="#concept">concept</a>ions in such a way as to reinforce these pre<a href="#concept">concept</a>ions. Hence, <a href="#attention">attention</a> to certain stimuli will guide subsequent <a href="#act">act</a>ion so that those stimuli are confirmed as important. The result of the process of en<a href="#act">act</a>ment is the en<a href="#act">act</a>ed environment (Weick, 1988). This en<a href="#act">act</a>ed environment comprises "real" objects but the significance, meaning and content of these objects will vary. These objects are not significant unless they are <a href="#act">act</a>ed upon and incorporated into events, situations and explanations. In this way the en<a href="#act">act</a>ed environment is a direct result of the pre<a href="#concept">concept</a>ions held by the social <a href="#act">act</a>or. An en<a href="#act">act</a>ed environment is inte<a href="#rna">rna</a>lised by social <a href="#act">act</a>ors as the way in which <a href="#act">act</a>ions have led to certain consequences; it is therefore analogous to the <a href="#concept">concept</a> of <a href="#schema">schema</a> and is the source of expectations for future <a href="#act">act</a>ion (Weick, 1988) . An en<a href="#act">act</a>ed environment is "a map of if-then assertions in which <a href="#act">act</a>ions are related outcomes" that in turn serve as expectations for future <a href="#act">act</a>ion and focus <a href="#perception">perception</a> in such way that these preconceived relationships will be supported. The importance of the notion of en<a href="#act">act</a>ment is that it provides a direct <a href="#link">link</a> between individual cognitive processes and environments. By showing how pre<a href="#concept">concept</a>ions can shape the nature of the environment this <a href="#concept">concept</a> allows one to argue the importance of <a href="#schema">schema</a> in the <a href="#sense">sense</a>making process. Schema guide both <a href="#perception">perception</a> and inference (Fiske & Taylor, 1991) and so will 'en<a href="#act">act</a>' environment by assigning significance, meaning and content to objects perceived in the environment.

<div class="entry"><p id="functional analysis"> <div class="entrytitle">193. FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS</div><br>Functional analysis is a methodology that is used to explain the workings of a complex system. The basic idea is that the system is viewed as computing a function (or, more generally, as solving an information processing problem). Functional analysis assumes that such processing can be explained by decomposing this complex function into a set of simpler funct<a href="#ions">ions</a> that are computed by an organized system of subprocessors. The hope is that when this type of decomposition is performed, the subfunct<a href="#ions">ions</a> that are defined will be simpler than the original function, and as a result will be easier to explain. A very detailed treatment of <a href="#functional analysis">functional analysis</a> is provided by Cummins (1983). He proposes a three-stage methodology that defines <a href="#functional analysis">functional analysis</a>. In the first stage, the to-be-explained function is defined. In the second stage, analysis is performed. The to-be-explained function is decomposed into an organized set of simpler funct<a href="#ions">ions</a>. This analysis can proceed recursively by decomposing some (or all) of the subfunct<a href="#ions">ions</a> into sub-subfunct<a href="#ions">ions</a>. In the third stage, analysis is stopped by subsuming the bottom level of funct<a href="#ions">ions</a>. This means that the operation of each of these operation is explained by appealing to natural laws (e.g., mechanical or biological principles). If <a href="#functional analysis">functional analysis</a> is applied to an information processing system, then the level of subsumed funct<a href="#ions">ions</a> defines the <a href="#functional architecture">functional architecture</a> for that information processor. Functional analysis is important to <a href="#cognitive science">cognitive science</a> because it offers a natural methodology for explaining how information processing is being carried out. For instance, any "black box diagram" offered as a <a href="#model">model</a> or <a href="#theory">theory</a> by a cogntive psychologist represents the result of carrying out the analytic stage of <a href="#functional analysis">functional analysis</a>. Any proposal about what constitutes the cognitive architecture can be viewed as a hypothesis about the nature of cognitive funct<a href="#ions">ions</a> at the level at which these funct<a href="#ions">ions</a> are subsumed.

<div class="entry"><p id="functional architecture"> <div class="entrytitle">194. FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE</div><br>The <a href="#functional architecture">functional architecture</a> can be viewed as the set of basic information processing capabilities available to an information processing system. "Specifying the <a href="#functional architecture">functional architecture</a> of a system is like providing a manual that defines some programming language. Indeed, defining a programming language is equivalent to specifying the <a href="#functional architecture">functional architecture</a> of a virtual machine" (Pylyshyn, 1984, p. 92). In other words, if it is assumed that <a href="#cognition">cognition</a> is the result of the brain's "running of a program", then the <a href="#functional architecture">functional architecture</a> is the language in which that program has been written. The <a href="#functional architecture">functional architecture</a> is of interest to <a href="#cognitive science">cognitive science</a> because if offers an escape from Ryle's Regress (a.k.a. the homunculus problem). The <a href="#functional architecture">functional architecture</a> is comprised of a set of <a href="#primitive">primitive</a> operat<a href="#ions">ions</a> or funct<a href="#ions">ions</a>. This means that these basic funct<a href="#ions">ions</a> cannot be explained by being further decomposed into less complex ("smaller") subfunct<a href="#ions">ions</a>. Instead, they must be explained by appealing to implementational properties (e.g., for human <a href="#cognition">cognition</a>, properties of the human brain).

<div class="entry"><p id="humor"> <div class="entrytitle">221. HUMOR</div><br>There are many reasons why people find something <a href="#humor">humor</a>ous, which are reflected in the large number of theories on the subject. Humor has been related to aggression, incongruity, and surprise. The cognitive psychologist's interest in the subject is usually related to the notion that <a href="#humor">humor</a> stems from a resolution of incongruity. For example, consider this joke by W.C. Field. "Do you believe in clubs for children?" "Only when kindness fails". Schultz(1974) offered a three step <a href="#theory">theory</a> of processing. In the first stage, the listener notices the incorrect interpretation of the ambiguous element (clubs = social groups). In the second step, the incorrect element of incongruity is processed ( "only when kindness fails"). In the final stage the hidden meaning of the ambiguous element is perceived (clubs = sticks). The incongruity resolution <a href="#theory">theory</a> explains the f<a href="#act">act</a> that a joke previously encountered will seem less funny on subsequent exposure. Similarly, Freud (1905, in Minsky 1985) suggested that <a href="#humor">humor</a>ous stories are a way of fooling our inte<a href="#rna">rna</a>l censors. A joke's power comes from a description that fits two different <a href="#frame">frame</a>s at once. The first meaning must be transparent and innocent, while the second meaning is disguised and reprehensible. Although most cognitive psychologists have not extended their theorizing to <a href="#humor">humor</a>, it does have an important cognitive aspect. In particular, cognitive <a href="#theory">theory</a> helps provide an explanation of why verbal jokes are found amusing by looking at the comprehension processes involved. Kristal, L. ed. (1981).

INCIDENTAL LEARNING PARADIGM</div><br>The incidental learning paradigm is an experimental paradigm used to investigate learning without intent. Using this paradigm, several groups of subjects are presented with the same list of items (e.g., 20 words) and are instructed to process them in different ways (different orienting condit<a href="#ions">ions</a>), with each group asked to perform a different <a href="#act">act</a>ivity or orienting task with the list. For example, count the number of letters in each word (shallow processing); name a rhyming word for each item (again, shallow processing, but deeper than #1; form an image of each word and rate the vividness of each image (deep processing). Importantly, subjects are not told that there will be a subsequent test of <a href="#memory">memory</a>. At the end of the list presentation, subjects are unexpectedly asked to recall as many of the words as possible. Processing information at a deeper level results in superior recall of that information (Eysenck, 1974).<br><div class="source">http://penta.ufrgs.br/edu/telelab/3/entries.htm</div><br>

INDUCTIVE (PRAGMATIC) INFERENCE</div><br>Inferences are made when a person (or machine) goes beyond available evidence to form a conclusion. An inductive inference is one which is likely to be true because of the state of the world. Unlike deductive inferences, inductive inferences do yield consclus<a href="#ions">ions</a> that increase the semantic information over and above that found in the initial premises. However, in the case of inductive inferences, we cannot be sure that our conclusion is a logical result of the premises, but we may be able to assign a likelihood to each conclusion. Similar to deductive inference, <a href="#induction">induction</a> can be broken down into three stages. The first stage is to understand the observation or stated information. The second is to form a hypothesis that attempts to describe the above information in relation to t person's general knowledge. The resulting conclusion goes beyond initial information by incorporating one's general knowledge in the result. The third step is to evaluate the validity of the conclusion that was reached.

<div class="entry"><p id="levels of processing"> <div class="entrytitle">251. LEVELS OF PROCESSING</div><br>An influential <a href="#theory">theory</a> of <a href="#memory">memory</a> proposed by Craik and Lockhart (1972) which rejected the idea of the dual store <a href="#model">model</a> of <a href="#memory">memory</a>. This popular <a href="#model">model</a> postulated that char<a href="#act">act</a>eristics of a <a href="#memory">memory</a> are determined by it's "location" (ie, fragile <a href="#memory">memory</a> trace in short term store [STS] and a more durable <a href="#memory">memory</a> trace in the long term store [LTS]. Instead, Craik and Lockhart proposed that information could be processed in a number of different ways and the durability or strength of the <a href="#memory">memory</a> trace was a direct function of the depth of processing involved. Moreover, depth of processing was postulated to fall on a shallow to deep continuum. Shallow processing (e.g., processing words based on their phonemic and orthographic components) leads to a fragile <a href="#memory">memory</a> trace that is susceptible to rapid forgetting. On the other had, deep processing (e.g., semantic or meaning based processing) results in a more durable <a href="#memory">memory</a> trace. A typical paradigm employed to investigate the Levels of Processing <a href="#theory">theory</a> is the incidental learning paradigm. Results reveal superior recall for items processed deeply compared to those items processed at the more shallow level (Eysenck, 1974: Hyde & Jenkins, 1969). Craik and Lockhart also distinguished between two kinds of rehearsal, maintenance and <a href="#elaborative rehearsal">elaborative rehearsal</a>. Of the two, <a href="#elaborative rehearsal">elaborative rehearsal</a> is the most effective in p<a href="#rod">rod</a>ucing a more durable <a href="#memory">memory</a> trace.

<div class="entry"><p id="linguistic determination"> <div class="entrytitle">255. LINGUISTIC DETERMINATION</div><br>Linguistic determination is the argument that language directly effects that way that people think about and see the world. Linguistic determination is also known as the Whorfian hypothesis or the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (Sapir, 1968; Whorf, 1956). Whorf provides the example of the Eskimo words for snow. The Eskimo people are inhabitants of the Arctic. Whereas in the English language there is only one word for snow the Eskimo language has many words for snow. Whorf argues that this language for snow allows the Eskimo people to "see" snow differently than speakers of other languages who do not have as many words for snow. That is, Eskimo people see subtle differences in snow that other people do not. Re<a href="#search">search</a>ers have studied color <a href="#perception">perception</a> across different linguistic groups to find support for the Whorfian hypothesis (Berlin & Kay, 1969; Heider, 1972); Heider & D. Oliver, 1973; G.A. Miller & Johnson-Laird, 1976; Rosch, 1974). The evidence indicates that people of all <a href="#culture">culture</a>s perceive colour in the same way. The tentative conclusion is that language does not determine the way that people think. It is possible that language, while not determining the way that people think may influence the way that people think. Ex<a href="#act">act</a>ly how language might influence thought is yet unclear.<br><div class="source">http://penta.ufrgs.br/edu/telelab/3/entries.htm</div><br>

<div class="entry"><p id="modularity"> <div class="entrytitle">299. MODULARITY</div><br>Jerry Fodor (1983) is the strongest proponent of a modular <a href="#theory">theory</a> of <a href="#cognition">cognition</a>. Fodor argues that certain psychological processes are self contained or modular. This is in contrast to "New look" or Modern Cognitivist posit<a href="#ions">ions</a> which hold that nearly all psychological processes are interconnected, and freely exchange information. Fodor proposes a three tiered cognitive system. The first level of the system, the "transducer level," transforms environmental signals into a form that can be used by the cognizing organism. The second level, the i<a href="#np">np</a>ut systems level, performs basic re<a href="#cognition">cognition</a> and description funct<a href="#ions">ions</a>. In Fodor's <a href="#model">model</a> i<a href="#np">np</a>ut systems are modular. The third level of the system, higher level cognitive funct<a href="#ions">ions</a>, performs complex operat<a href="#ions">ions</a> on the output of the i<a href="#np">np</a>ut systems. An example of a higher level process is analogous thinking. Fodor holds that i<a href="#np">np</a>ut systems are modular and that higher level cognitive processes are nonmodular. This means that all of the information necessary for performing their tasks of re<a href="#cognition">cognition</a> and description is contained within the i<a href="#np">np</a>ut systems. For example, object <a href="#perception">perception</a> might be modular, in which case the object <a href="#perception">perception</a> module need not <a href="#reference">reference</a> language modules, or music modules, or mathematics modules in order to perform its operat<a href="#ions">ions</a>. In contrast, higher level processes have access to all information contained within the cognitive system when performing a given operation. Fodor provides the example of scientific reasoning (a higher level cognitive process). Potentially, when solving a scientific problem, the scientist can <a href="#reference">reference</a> any knowledge that he or she has about the world to help in solving this problem. As such, if necessary, knowledge about botany can be <a href="#reference">reference</a>d in order to understand problems in mathematics. Modular systems have the following properties: 1) They are domain specific they operate on, and have a <a href="#computation">computation</a>al architecture that is un<a href="#iq">iq</a>ue to certain stimuli, 2) Their operation is mandatory, or they are cognitively impenetrable beliefs cannot affect the operat<a href="#ions">ions</a> of modules, we cannot help seeing, or hearing the world in a certain way, 3) Modules are fast modular processes are among the fastest psychological processes,this is because modules are self-contained and need not spend time referencing information outside of the module to complete their tasks, 4) Modules are informationally encapsulated they need not <a href="#reference">reference</a> any other psycholgical systems in order to perform their operat<a href="#ions">ions</a>, and 5) Modules have shallow outputs the output of modules is very basic, more complex <a href="#representation">representation</a>s follow after higher level <a href="#computation">computation</a>.

<div class="entry"><p id="piaget's stage theory of development"> <div class="entrytitle">368. PIAGET'S STAGE THEORY OF DEVELOPMENT</div><br>Piaget was among other things, a psychologist who was interested in cognitive development. After observation of many children, he posited that children progress through 4 stages and that they all do so in the same order. These four stages are described below. The Sensorimotor Period (birth to 2 years): During this time, Piaget said that a child's cognitive system is limited to motor reflexes at birth, but the child builds on these reflexes to develop more sophisicated procedures. They learn to generalize their <a href="#act">act</a>ivities to a wider range of situat<a href="#ions">ions</a> and coordinate them into increasingly lengthy chains of behaviour. PreOperational Thought (2 to 6 or 7 years): At this age, according to Piaget, children acquire <a href="#representation">representation</a>al skills in the areas mental imagery, and especially language. They are very self-oriented, and have an egocentric view; that is, preoperational chldren can use these <a href="#representation">representation</a>al skills only to view the world from their own perspective. Concrete Operat<a href="#ions">ions</a> (6/7 to 11/12): As opposed to Preoperational children, children in the concrete operat<a href="#ions">ions</a> stage are able to take another's point of view and take into account more than one perspective simultaneously. They can also represent transformat<a href="#ions">ions</a> as well as static situat<a href="#ions">ions</a>. Although they can understand concrete problems, Piaget would argue that they cannot yet perform on abstr<a href="#act">act</a> problems, and that they do not consider all of the logically possible outcomes. Formal Operat<a href="#ions">ions</a> (11/12 to adult): Children who attain the formal operation stage are capable of thinking logically and abstr<a href="#act">act</a>ly. They can also reason theoretically. Piaget considered this the ultimate stage of development, and stated that although the children would still have to revise their knowledge base, their way of thinking was as powerful as it would get. It is now thought that not every child reaches the formal operation stage. Developmental psychologists also debate whether children do go through the stages in the way that Piaget postulated. Whether Piaget was correct or not, however, it is safe to say that this <a href="#theory">theory</a> of cognitive development has had a tremendous influence on all modern developmental psychologists.

Priming is discussed in the context of the <a href="#act">act</a>ivation <a href="#theory">theory</a>. It is assumed that <a href="#concept">concept</a>s that have some relation to each other are connected in some mental network, so that if one <a href="#concept">concept</a> is <a href="#act">act</a>ivated, then <a href="#concept">concept</a>s related to it are also <a href="#act">act</a>ivated. Priming is a phenomenon related to this <a href="#concept">concept</a>. It can be shown in the following example: A subject is shown the word nurse. Presumably the subject will then think of other words related to the word nurse. If the subject is then shown either the word doctor or the word butter, the subject should be able to read the former word more quickly than the latter word because " doctor" is related to " nurse" and therefore has been recently accessed, and so more familiar to the subject. The word nurse then serves to "prime" the second word, doctor.<br><div class="source">http://penta.ufrgs.br/edu/telelab/3/entries.htm</div><br>

Complex systems can be decomposed into simpler things, but <a href="#primitive">primitive</a>s - by definition - cannot. To provide an example that gives a nice intuition about what a <a href="#primitive">primitive</a> is, consider teaching a child the meanings of different words. If a child asks us "What does `bachelor' mean?", we might break "bachelor down into other meanings ("`Bachelor' means that someone is a `man' who is `not married'"). However, if a child asks us "What does `red' mean?", we are not likely to do this, because it is difficult to decompose such a basic term. Instead, we are more likely to point to different things that are `red'. In this <a href="#sense">sense</a>, `red' represents something that we might call a semantic <a href="#primitive">primitive</a> (a basic meaning), while `bachelor' does not. Primitives are important in <a href="#cognitive science">cognitive science</a> because of its tendency to view information processors functionally instead of physically. Because of this view, re<a href="#search">search</a>ers use a methodology called <a href="#functional analysis">functional analysis</a> to decompose a complex information processor into simpler, functional components.

RELATIVE COMPLEXITY EVIDENCE</div><br>One of the key goals of <a href="#cognitive science">cognitive science</a> is to develop theories that are strongly equivalent with respect to to-be-explained systems. This requires that evidence be collected to defend the claim that the <a href="#model">model</a> and the to-be-explained system are carrying out the same procedures to compute a function. One type of evidence that can be used to defend this claim is called <a href="#relative complexity evidence">relative complexity evidence</a>. Imagine that someone is proposing that a Turing machine is a strongly equivalent <a href="#model">model</a> of how children do mental arithmetic. To collect <a href="#relative complexity evidence">relative complexity evidence</a> concerning this claim, we could present a number of different addition problems to the Turing machine, and then rank order them in terms of the number of processing steps that each problem required. We could then present the same problems to a group of children, and rank order the difficulty they caused the children on the basis of re<a href="#act">act</a>ion time taken to solve the problems. If the two systems are strongly equivalent, then we would expect the same rank-orderings to be obtained for both the Turing machine and the children. If they are not strongly equivalent (as we would expect in this example), then differen rank-orderings would emerge because different procedures are used to solve the problems. Pylyshyn, Z.W. (1984).

<div class="entry"><p id="ryle's regress"> <div class="entrytitle">436. RYLE'S REGRESS</div><br>Ryle's Regress is a classic argument against cognitivist theories, and concludes that such theories cannot be scientific. The philosopher Gilbert Ryle (1949) was concerned with crit<a href="#iq">iq</a>uing what he called the intellectualist legend, which required intelligent <a href="#act">act</a>s to be the p<a href="#rod">rod</a>uct of the conscious application of mental <a href="#rule">rule</a>s. Ryle (p. 31) argued that the intellectualist legend results in an infinite regress of thought: "According to the legend, whenever an agent does anything intelligently, his <a href="#act">act</a> is preceded and steered by another inte<a href="#rna">rna</a>l <a href="#act">act</a> of considering a regulative <a href="#proposition">proposition</a> appropriate to his pr<a href="#act">act</a>ical problem. [...] Must we then say that for the hero's reflect<a href="#ions">ions</a> how to <a href="#act">act</a> to be intelligent he must first reflect how best to reflect how to <a href="#act">act</a>? The endlessness of this implied regress shows that the aplication of the appropriateness does not entail the occurrence of a process of considering this criterion." Variants of Ryle's Regress are commonly aimed at cognitivist theories. For instance, in order to explain the behavior of rats, Edward Tolman (e.g., 1932, 1948) found that he had to use terms that modern cognitive scientists would be very comfortable with. For instance, Tolman suggested that his rats were constructing a "cognitive map" that helped them locate reinforcers, and he used intentional terms (e.g., expectancies, purposes, meanings) to describe their behavior. This led to a famous attack on Tolman's work by Guthrie (1935, p. 172): "Signs, in Tolman's <a href="#theory">theory</a>, occasion in the rat realization, or <a href="#cognition">cognition</a>, or judgement, or hypotheses, or abstr<a href="#act">act</a>ion, but they do not occasion <a href="#act">act</a>ion. In his concern with what goes on in the rat's mind, Tolman has neglected to predict what the rat will do. So far as the <a href="#theory">theory</a> is concerned the rate is left buried in thought; if he gets to the food-box at the end that is his concern, not the concern of the <a href="#theory">theory</a>." Cognitive scientists must be constantly aware of Ryle's Regress as a potential problem with their theories, and must ensure that their theories include a principled account of how the (potentially) infinite regress that emerges from <a href="#functional analysis">functional analysis</a> can be stopped.

After entering the <a href="#sensory store">sensory store</a>, some information proceeds into the short-term store. This short-term store is commonly refered to as short-term <a href="#memory">memory</a>. Short-term <a href="#memory">memory</a> has two important char<a href="#act">act</a>eristics. First, short-term <a href="#memory">memory</a> can contain at any one time seven, plus or minus two, "chunks" of informaton. Second, items remain in short-term <a href="#memory">memory</a> around twenty seconds. These un<a href="#iq">iq</a>ue char<a href="#act">act</a>eristics, among others, suggested to re<a href="#search">search</a>ers that short-term <a href="#memory">memory</a> was autonomous from sensory and long-term <a href="#memory">memory</a> stores. Craik and Lockhart (1972) argued short-term <a href="#memory">memory</a> was not autonomous from the other <a href="#memory">memory</a> systems.

SUSTAINED ATTENTION</div><br>Sustained <a href="#attention">attention</a> is "the ability to direct and focus cognitive <a href="#act">act</a>ivity on specific stimuli." In order to complete any cognitively planned <a href="#act">act</a>ivity, any sequenced <a href="#act">act</a>ion, or any thought one must use sustained <a href="#attention">attention</a>. An example is the <a href="#act">act</a> of reading a newspaper article. One must be able to focus on the <a href="#act">act</a>ivity of reading long enough to complete the task. Problems occur when a distr<a href="#act">act</a>ion arises. A distr<a href="#act">act</a>ion can interrupt and consequently interfere in sustained <a href="#attention">attention</a>. DeGangi and Porges (1990) indicate there are 3 stages to sustained <a href="#attention">attention</a> which include: <a href="#attention">attention</a> getting, <a href="#attention">attention</a> holding, and <a href="#attention">attention</a> releasing. Sustained <a href="#attention">attention</a> is important to psychologists because it is "a basic requirement for information processing." Therefore, sustained <a href="#attention">attention</a> is important for cognitive development. When a person has difficulty sustaining <a href="#attention">attention</a>, they often present with an accompanying inability to adapt to environmental demands or modify behaviour (including inhibition of inappropriate behaviour).

The most basic perceptual systems are located at the bottom of the hierarchy, and the most complex cogntive (e.g. <a href="#memory">memory</a>, problem solving) systems are located at the top of the hierarchy. Information can flow both from the bottom of the system to the top of the system and from the top of the system to the bottom of the system. When information flows from the top of the sytstem to the bottom of the system this is called "top-down" processing. The implicat<a href="#ions">ions</a> of this top to bottom flow if information is that information coming into the system (perceptually) can be influenced by what the individual already knows about the information that is coming into the system (as information about past experiences are stored in the higher levels of the system).

<div class="entry"><p id="turing test"> <div class="entrytitle">507. TURING TEST</div><br> A test to determine if an artificially intelligence machine is successful. It is successful if its answers to quest<a href="#ions">ions</a> are indistinguishable from the answers a human would give.<br><div class="source">https://web.archive.org/web/20090415100452/http://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~pli/teaching/psy333/glossary.html</div><br>
The Turing test is a behavioural approach to determining whether or not a system is intelligent. It was originally proposed by mathematician Alan Turing, one of the founding figures in computing. Turing argued in a 1950 paper that conversation was the key to judging intelligence. In the Turing test, a judge has conversat<a href="#ions">ions</a> (via teletype) with two systems, one human, the other a machine. The conversat<a href="#ions">ions</a> can be about anything, and proceed for a set period of time (e.g., an hour). If, at the end of this time, the judge cannot distinguish the machine from the human on the basis of the conversation, then Turing argued that we would have to say that the machine was intelligent. There are a number of different views about the utility of the Turing test in <a href="#cognitive science">cognitive science</a>. Some re<a href="#search">search</a>ers argue that it is the benchmark test of what Searle calls strong AI, and as a result is crucial to defining intelligence. Other re<a href="#search">search</a>ers take the position that the Turing test is too weak to be useful in this way, because many different systems can generate correct behaviours for incorrect (i.e., unintelligent) reasons. Famous examples of this are Weizenbaum's ELIZA program and Colby's PARRY program. Indeed, the general acceptance of ELIZA as being "intelligent" so appalled Weizenbaum that he withdrew from mainstream AI re<a href="#search">search</a>, which he attacked in his landmark 1976 book.

<div class="entry"><p id="wais"> <div class="entrytitle">524. WAIS</div><br>The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)was developed by Wechsler in 1955. An updated version of the scale (WAIS-R) was developed in 1981. WAIS measures global or general intelligence and is commonly used by psychologists. It is divided into 2 parts: the verbal scale and the performance scale. Each of these 2 parts is further divided into subtests each of which taps a specific verbal or nonverbal skill. Each subtest has items ranging from easy to increasingly more difficult. Verbal subtests measure "our store of knowldedge." (Belsky, 1990, p. 120) They focus on "learned or absorbed knowledge" testing "knowledge of historical, literary or biological f<a href="#act">act</a>s; knowledge relating to competent functioning in the world; knowledge of mathematics; knowledge of the meaning of specific words." (Belsky, 1990, p. 120) Performance subtests (except picture completion) contain relatively unfamiliar tasks. They measure "on-the-spot analytical skills, how well a person can master a new, never before encountered problem." (Belsky, 1990, p. 120) Speed is critical to these tasks as these subtests are timed. The IQ measure of a person is derived by comparison to a particular <a href="#reference">reference</a> group, to people of that test subject's age group. Therefore, the raw score has a different meaning depending upon the test subject's age. The WAIS is not only important to psychologists as a commonly used assessment tool, but it is often at the centre of the debate of whether or not intelligence declines with age. It is questionable whether the current intelligence tests (specifically the WAIS) are appropriate for use with older persons. Belsky (1990) says critics must be "looking critically at the appropriateness of the measures themselves, questioning whether existing tests of intelligence are really doing an adequate job of tapping cognitive ability in middle-aged and elderly adults." (p. 119) Belsky asks further if "the dramatic age decline is confined mainly to particular subtests. Would we see the same age loss if we looked at data other than the cross-sectional studies used to determine the norms?" (p. 121) Belsky, Janet K. (1990).

<div class="entry"><p id="weak equivalence"> <div class="entrytitle">526. WEAK EQUIVALENCE</div><br>Weak equivalence is a relat<a href="#ions">ions</a>hip between the outputs of two systems that are being compared. If these systems are only weakly equivalent, then we can say that they are computing the same function (or generating the same exte<a href="#rna">rna</a>l behavior), but that they are using different procedures to do so. For example, human chess players and computer chess players are weakly equivalent, in the <a href="#sense">sense</a> that they both play the game of chess, but use very different procedures to decide which move to make next in a game. (Computer chess players usually use some form of intensive <a href="#search">search</a>, which is beyond the <a href="#memory">memory</a> capacity of human players. Indeed, an interesting question is how humans can play chess so well given that they do not use brute force <a href="#search">search</a> methods!) Weak equivalence is important in <a href="#cognitive science">cognitive science</a> in two respects. First, it is the kind of comparison that the Turing test offers, which is why it is also sometimes called Turing equivalence. Second, although <a href="#weak equivalence">weak equivalence</a> is necessary for validating theories in <a href="#cognitive science">cognitive science</a>, it is not sufficient.
